We're no strangers to love

You know the rules and so do I

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.700
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.700

Your heart's been aching but
you're too shy to say it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.900

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.100
We know the game and we're gonna play it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.600
